# Model Context Protocol Implementation Plan

## Key Concepts

### Overview
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a client-server protocol designed for AI/LLM applications to interact with external context providers. It enables modular and extensible capabilities for AI assistants through a standardized communication protocol.

### Core Components

1. **Host**
   - Acts as container and coordinator
   - Manages multiple client instances
   - Controls connection permissions and lifecycle
   - Enforces security policies
   - Coordinates AI/LLM integration

2. **Client**
   - Maintains 1:1 connection with a server
   - Handles protocol negotiation
   - Routes messages bidirectionally
   - Manages subscriptions and notifications

3. **Server**
   - Provides specialized context and capabilities
   - Exposes resources, tools, and prompts
   - Operates independently
   - Handles sampling requests

### Protocol Details
- Based on JSON-RPC 2.0
- Supports multiple transport layers (HTTP+SSE, stdio)
- Message Types:
  - Requests (bidirectional with response)
  - Responses (results or errors)
  - Notifications (one-way messages)
