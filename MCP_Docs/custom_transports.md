## Custom Transports

Clients and servers MAY implement additional custom transport mechanisms to suit their specific needs. The protocol is transport-agnostic and can be implemented over any communication channel that supports bidirectional message exchange.

Implementers who choose to support custom transports MUST ensure they preserve the JSON-RPC message format and lifecycle requirements defined by MCP. Custom transports SHOULD document their specific connection establishment and message exchange patterns to aid interoperability.
